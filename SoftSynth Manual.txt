Raspberry Pi Softsynth Manual

1. Overview

	Software synth on Raspberry Pi intended for "embedded" use (eg: to make an actual hardware synthesiser).
 	Developed on Raspbian using C++ and SDL2. Hopefully in future will run on minimal fast-boot Linux OS.

2. Features

	To sound good: 
	- 16 notes polyphonic (32 oscillators)
	- Multi-timbral (2 oscillators per played note)
	- DAPDSR envelopes (delay/attack/peak/decay/sustain/release)
	- Various oscillator waveforms
		+ SINE/SQUARE/SAW/TRI/NOISE/CUSTOM
		+ Adjustable duty cycle ("phase distortion")
		+ Detune
	- LFO and modulation
		- Various LFO waveforms
		- Route LFO to volume, pitch, filter, PWM
	- Effects on individual notes:
		- Lowpass filter (TODO - 2 or 3 types)
	- Effects on master output
		- Compression
		- Reverb / delay
	- [TODO] Sample playback
		- For audio tracks
	- [TODO] Custom waveform editor

	Control:
	- Triggering notes (from MIDI device)
		- Handle MIDI note on / note off messages
		- MIDI note velocity
		- Handle "running" note on/off messages (?)
	- Modulation
		- MIDI Pitch bend messages
		- MIDI Mod wheel messages
	- Tweaking parameters
		- Handle MIDI control messages from MIDI controller
		- Handle MIDI control messages from GUI process
		- Use de-facto standard message numbers
	- Selecting patches
		- MIDI patch select messages
		- Use de-facto standards for patch select
	- [TODO] Mapping MIDI channels to patches
		- For supporting keyboard splits, drums etc
	- [TODO] Arpeggiator
		- Various patterns
		- Custom patterns
		- Various speeds
	- [TODO] Timing and sync
		- Set BPM (for arpegiattor, sequencer etc)
		- Sync to external (MIDI sync)

	Composing:
	- [TODO] Sequencer
		- Sends MIDI message to the synth engine
		- Separate app from the synth engine?
		- Tracker? "Phrase sequencer"?
	- [TODO] Composing tools (?)




3. Design/Implementation:

- Synth engine "synth" running in one process
	- Processes messages and generates audio output
	- Audio mixing/output running in separate thread
- Synth GUI "synthgui" running in another process
- Sequencer etc running in other processes/cores
- GUI and synth / sequencer talk to each other using IPC (mqueue)
- OO C++
- Portability?


CWaveSynth Object:
	- Manages Patches
		- Patch collection
		- Save / load patches
		- Copy patches
	- Manages active voices
		- Assigns voices (NoteOn())
		- Sets up voices with Patch settings
		- Updates voices

			- Update voice vol/pitch filter from patch LFO
			- Disables voice after release finished
	- Mixes voices to output buffer (using CMixer)
	- Handles transpose
	- Recieves and processes MIDI messages:
		- MIDI note on/off
		- MIDI control change
			- Pitch bend and modulation
			- Patch change
			- Tweak knobs

			- Waveform   
			- Duty cycle (PWM)
			- Detune
			- volume envelope
			- pitch envelope
			- filter envelope
			- PWM envelope
			- LFO waveform
			- LFO freq
			- LFO pitch envelope	(sets level from "sustain" level)  (	vibrato)
			- LFO volume envelope	(sets level)  (tremolo)
			- LFO filter envelope	(sets level)
			- LFO PWM envelope      (sets level)

		- Modulation			"CModulator" class
			- Pitch bend range
			- Modulation range
			- Modulation target(s)
				- PWM      (relative)
				- Filter   (relative)
				- LFO freq (relative)
